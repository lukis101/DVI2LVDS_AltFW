# DVI2LVDS_AltFW
An alternative firmware for [ZisWorks DVI2LVDS](http://www.zisworks.com/#dvi2lvds)  
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  

Not feature-complete, but good enough for daily use. Main features include:
* DDC-CI interface - adjust parameters from your computer!
* Strobing backlight mode with adjustable strobe length and offset (**Hardware modification needed**)
* Parameters for both backlight modes are saved individually  
_Aaaand some smaller features here and there..._..  

EDID can be written using serial interface which emulates a [BusPirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate).  
A tool for easy EEPROM interfacing through a BusPirate can be found [HERE](https://github.com/lukis101/BusP_EEP).
